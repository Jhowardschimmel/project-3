# Tabletop Assistant

Our app is valuable because it is often challenging to keep track and organize character sheets.
We are creating a character managment application for tabletop roleplaying game character sheets. The application will allow users to log in and identify themselves as a Game Master or player. Users will select their desired tabletop game system. Users will have the option to create a new character sheet or open an existing character sheet. Game Master users will have the ability to edit a players character sheet in real time. This application will allow players and Game Masters to have easy access to their character sheets and will facilitate Game Masters in guiding new or inexperienced players through the often complex character creation process. Additionaly Game Masters will be able to alter character sheets without overtly alerting players to the change.
